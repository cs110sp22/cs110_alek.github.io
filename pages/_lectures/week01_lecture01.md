By the end of this course, we want each of you to have written many computer programs, and have a solid grasp of some fundamental programming concepts. To do this, you're going to have to teach yourself the skills that you need to accomplish this goal by ***actively participating*** in the class. *Active* participation means (a) doing the readings, (b) watching the videos, (c) attending the lectures and lab sessions, and (d) completing the practice problems, labs, projects, and homework assignments.

We will be using regularly scheduled class time for live discussions of the slides, videos, coding activities, and / or readings that have been posted for the day.
* Please review the slides and videos before class
* Please attend the live lectures, code along, and ask questions
