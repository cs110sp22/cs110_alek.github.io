In this lesson, we're going to go over a few more examples of using files in the "real world." This includes:
1. reading files from disk and from the Internet,
2. manipulating file data into usable formats, and finally
3. writing files with the help of templates

We will also explore a new file format (HTML). In addition, we will also talk about error handling using `try/except` blocks.
