Today, we will be learning about dictionaries -- another way (in addition to lists and tuples) of storing and representing collections of related data. As a programmer, you will encounter dictionaries all of the time. We'll go over some common scenarios and take a look at many different kinds of dictionaries.

Then, next week, we'll go over how dictionaries can help you to group, tally, and analyze data.
